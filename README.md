# Elgar Platform
Elgar Ontology: Elgar ontology was created for Elgar IoT-Platform and the ontology was based on [IoT-Lite](https://www.w3.org/Submission/2015/SUBM-iot-lite-20151126/#:~:text=IoT%2DLite%20ontology%20is%20a,time%20when%20querying%20the%20ontology.).
The ontology contains the ontology file in Resouce Description File (RDF). Edited with [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/) ontology editor.

#Elgar Ontology:
The Elgar Ontology serves as a structured representation of knowledge related to IoT services and their context within the Elgar IoT-Platform.
It was specifically designed to enhance the functionality of the Elgar Platform by capturing essential information about IoT services, their properties, and their interactions.
The ontology is based on the IoT-Lite ontology, which provides a lightweight model for describing IoT devices, services, and their relationships.
By utilizing the Elgar Ontology, the Elgar Platform can achieve context-awareness, allowing it to adapt its behavior based on factors such as location, user preferences, and environmental conditions.

#Resource Description File (RDF):
The ontology file is stored in RDF format. RDF is a standard for representing semantic information, making it suitable for expressing relationships and connections between entities.
In RDF, information is structured as triples, consisting of a subject, a predicate (or property), and an object. These triples form a graph that represents knowledge.

#Protégé Ontology Editor:
The Elgar Ontology was created and edited using the Protégé ontology editor.
Protégé is a powerful tool for developing and managing ontologies. It allows ontology engineers to define classes, properties, and relationships, as well as create instances.
Researchers and developers can collaborate on ontology development using Protégé, ensuring consistency and accuracy.

Acknowledgment:
It’s great to know that this research received partial support from Interface Corporation, Japan. Collaborations like this contribute to advancements in IoT technologies.

Ontology Metadata:
Title: Elgar Ontology
Version: 0.4
Creator: Mohd Anuaruddin
Date: December 11, 2018
Description: An ontology specifically designed for the Elgar Platform, which is part of the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem.

Purpose and Context:
The Elgar Ontology serves as a structured representation of knowledge related to IoT services within the Elgar IoT-Platform.
It captures essential information about IoT services, their properties, and their interactions.
The ontology is based on the IoT-Lite ontology, which provides a lightweight model for describing IoT devices and services.

Annotation Properties:
altRelative: Represents relative altitude, especially useful in buildings where floor levels are relevant.
relativeLocation: Provides a place for where the device is located, using Geonames URIs (e.g., for “University of Surrey”).

Additional Notes:
The ontology is a working draft, indicating ongoing development and refinement.
